# Notes

## Bus Bar

I plan to use copper pipe 1/2 inch.

## Attachment to bus bar

copper rivets is the cheapeast option, best option is nutserts and m4 bolts.

## Connecting multiple boards.

using a 2p 18650 case you can join two boards together by placing the 2p case over the end cell spots (eg cell 4 on board 1 and cell 1 on board 2).
